## Overview

The purpose of this project report is to present the completed application for the simple and highly reliable inventory management system, Artifax. Developed to avoid unnecessary complication, the system provides a direct approach to tracking internal warehouse operations focusing entirely on internal warehouse components rather than external factors.

The core objective of the system is to deliver a highly scalable backend architecture capable of managing inventory quantities across at least two distinct locations. It enables the tracking of base materials and crafted items, manages production timelines and facilitates structured role-based access control. The system's development was guided by a distinct set of operational needs and analytical wants outlined during initial consultations.

## Test Coverage

### Frontend

We implemented unit and integration testing to verify our frontend code, which resulted in 17 passed and 4 failed test suites out of 21 total, and 35 passed and 4 failed individual tests out of 39 total as shown in image. The 4 failing tests belong to features that are still in production, so they are expected to fail until that development wraps up. 

As seen in image, our current code coverage metrics are 57.39% for Statements, 43.63% for Branches, 56.41% for Functions, and 57.9% for Lines, with the uncovered pages currently being fixed and refactored. For the core features that are completely finished like the components tested in BlueprintPanel.test.tsx, CraftingQueue.test.tsx, and NewBlueprint.test.tsx, the tests thoroughly check that data loads correctly from the backend, form buttons lock when inputs are missing and errors are handled safely. 

### Backend

We wrote unit tests throughout the backend on the majority of our controllers that test the functions we use on our endpoints in isolation. Our test suite was built using xUnit and we used both EF’ In-Memory Database and Moq to run our testing. Our total line coverage is only about 30%, but that number is being dropped significantly by files made by Entity Framework Core and Dotnet. We have especially high coverage on all of our controllers. We wrote 77 tests in total, all passed. Every test we wrote follows the Arrange Act Assert pattern to ensure readability and predictability. The tests primarily validated the Controllers.

This included verifying standard CRUD operations, complex relational updates, and ensuring the API returned the correct HTTP status codes for both working results and bad results. These metrics strongly reflect a robust test suite because the coverage wasn't just superficial. The tests thoroughly explored various execution paths, ensuring that our application correctly manipulates the database state (verifying item counts and property changes post-execution) and accurately maps Data Transfer Objects.

In terms of testing we employed a suite of technologies in order to engage in various forms of both manual and automatic. This includes:
- Jest and xUnit for automated testing of our frontend and backend applications. These two technologies were also built in additions to react and dotnet.
- Swagger and Insomnia for manual testing of backend during early to mid and later development accordingly.
